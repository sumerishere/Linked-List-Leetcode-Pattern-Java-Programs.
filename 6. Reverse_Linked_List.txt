6. Reverse Linked List (https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-linked-list).


    Sample Test Case: 

         Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5]
	 Output: [5,4,3,2,1]


     Solution: 
                           
		class Solution {
    		    public ListNode reverseList(ListNode head) {
        
       			if(head == null ){
           	           return head;
        		}
        
        		ListNode prev = null;   //temp node to catch the next after node.
        		ListNode curr = head;    // current node.
        
       			 while(curr != null){  
            
         		   ListNode next = curr.next;   //setting next pointer on current after node for reverse traversing.
                           curr.next = prev;   // that next pointer connect to previous back node.
            
            		   prev = curr;     //and assigning that prev node to as curr.
           		   curr = next;   //again that current move to next. 

        		}
      			return prev;   //final reverse list.
        
    		     }
		}
